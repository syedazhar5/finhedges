                        <j>An unlisted security is a financial instrument that is not traded on a formal
                            exchange because it does not meet listing requirements. Unlisted securities are also called
                            OTC securities, as trading is done on the over-the-counter(OTC) market mostly by market
                            makers.
                            Unlisted stocks can be tracked via pink sheets or on the OTCBB. Unlisted securities are
                            usually
                            issued by smaller or new firms that cannot or do not wish to comply with the requirements of
                            an
                            official exchange, such as market capitalization thresholds or listing fees. Furthermore,
                            because they are not exchange traded, unlisted securities are often less liquid than listed
                            securities. Unlisted stock can be tracked via pink sheets or on the Over-The-Counter
                            Bulletin
                            Board (OTCBB). A hedge fund is a pooled investment fund that trades in relatively liquid
                            assets
                            and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading, portfolio-construction, and risk
                            management techniques in an attempt to improve performance, such as short selling, leverage,
                            and

                        trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to
                        human traders. In the twenty-first century, algorithmic trading has been gaining traction with
                        both retail and institutional traders. It is widely used by investment banks, pension
                        funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds that may need to spread out the execution of a larger order
                        or perform trades too fast for human traders to react to. A study in 2019 showed that around 92%
                        of trading in the Forex market was performed by trading algorithms rather than humans. The term
                        algorithmic trading is often used synonymously with automated trading system. These encompass a
                        variety of trading strategies, some of which are based on formulas and results from mathematical
                        finance, and often rely on specialized software.
